## Why Blogging is Important?

Blogging helps you share knowledge, build a portfolio, and connect with like-minded people.

> "Blogging is not about publishing as much as you can. Itâ€™s about publishing as smart as you can." â€“ Jon Morrow

Here is some code:

\`\`\`javascript
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, Blog!");
}
\`\`\`

### Things to Remember:
. Write consistently.
. Be authentic.
. Always add value.

**Enjoy blogging!**
